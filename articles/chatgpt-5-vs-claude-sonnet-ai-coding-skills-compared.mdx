# ChatGPT 5 vs Claude Sonnet: AI Coding Skills Compared

What is the _future of coding_? It is **not just** about human ingenuity but also a **battle between AI giants**.

Imagine two giant models, OpenAI's **GPT-5** and Anthropic's **Claude Sonnet**, competing to build a game. One delivers _careful, rule-following_ solutions. The other is _fast_ and creates _visually stunning_ designs.
Yet, _neither one is perfect_.

This is a glimpse into how AI shapes the tools we use to solve problems in our day-to-day life. This includes designing UIs and managing business decisions. As a developer, I rely more on AI to finish boring tasks. But which model **truly gives the best results**?

In this comparison, we break down the **strengths, weaknesses, and surprising quirks** of GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet. We look at token efficiency, pricing, and their ability to handle complex tasks like authentication. You will discover how these models compare in real-world situations. Whether you are a developer who wants **precision** or **speed**, or just curious about how AI models solve problems, this will help you understand the trade-offs. By the end, you might ask not just which model is better, but what **_better_** really means in the world of AI development.

## Key Features of ChatGPT 5 and Claude Sonnet

**GPT-5** is OpenAI's latest model. It is built for **_advanced reasoning_** and can adapt to many different challenges. It uses a routing system to handle tasks in the best way possible. This makes it a **versatile tool** for developers.

**Claude Sonnet** is known for its **_raw speed_** and for creating outputs that look **_visually refined_**. It is for developers who want **efficiency** and **beautiful design**.

Both models help with coding and problem-solving, but they work in **dramatically different ways**.

## Performance in Building a Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe Game

We tested their coding skills by asking both models to create a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game. The results showed **clear strengths and weaknesses**:

- **GPT-5**: Made a **_functional and robust_** solution. However, its interface was _visually basic_ and needed more design work.
- **Claude Sonnet**: Created a **_polished interface_** but sometimes added _unnecessary fields_, making the code more complex.

Both models had _minor coding errors_ a reminder that **human review is always required**.

## Impact of Rule Adherence on Model Performance

We tested how well the models followed specific rules. The models behaved **very differently**:

- **GPT-5**: Was _slower_ but **_more deliberate_**. It often gave _thoughtful and detailed_ solutions that followed the rules closely.
- **Claude Sonnet**: Was _blazing fast_ but sometimes **_struggled with conventions_**. This led to small mistakes in its output.

These differences show how each model's **built-in style** affects its work.

## Challenges in Authentication Implementation

Tasks like adding login systems were **surprisingly challenging** for both models. The results showed:

- Both models had problems with environment variables. These issues needed _manual fixes_.
- **GPT-5**: Used web searches to help. This often led to **_more complete and reliable_** solutions.
- **Claude Sonnet**: Was fast but sometimes made functions that were **_incomplete or less reliable_**.

This shows that **authentication is complex**. Developers must always check the AI's output.

## Token Efficiency and Cost Implications

How a model uses **tokens** affects its **cost**. This comparison showed different patterns:

- **GPT-5**: Used _more tokens_ because of its **_detailed thinking process_**. This often led to _higher-quality outputs_.
- **Claude Sonnet**: Used _fewer tokens_ but relied heavily on its context window. However, its _higher price per token_ is a key factor.

This shows the **trade-off** between **_deep reasoning_** and **_token efficiency_**.

## Pricing and Cost Analysis: Getting the Most Bang for Your Buck

Let's talk money! üí∞ **Cost is a massive factor** when you're choosing an AI model for your projects. You want power, but you also need to keep an eye on the budget.

Here‚Äôs the latest pricing breakdown (but remember: _prices can change, so always double-check the official sources!_).

### Side-by-Side Price Tag üè∑Ô∏è

| Model             | Input Price (per 1M tokens) | Output Price (per 1M tokens) |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **GPT-5**         | **$1.25**                   | **$10.00**                   |
| **Claude Sonnet** | **$3.00**                   | **$15.00**                   |

### The Output Cost, Visualized üìä

Seeing the difference in output cost really puts things into perspective:

**Cost for 1 Million Output Tokens**

```
$20 |
$15 |            ‚ñà
$10 |    ‚ñà       ‚ñà
 $5 |    ‚ñà       ‚ñà
 $0 +--------------------
        GPT-5  Claude
```

**So, what does this mean for you?**

Think of it like this:

- **GPT-5** is like a **budget-friendly bulk store**. The _price per token is lower_, which is fantastic for large, complex tasks where you need deep, high-quality reasoning.
- **Claude Sonnet** might have a _higher price per token_, but its ability to sometimes **use fewer tokens overall** on shorter tasks can make its total cost competitive for quick jobs.

**The bottom line?** Your choice ultimately depends on your project's specific **needs and budget**. If you prioritize cost-efficiency on big projects, GPT-5 has the edge. For quick, token-light tasks, Claude might be your guy!

## Strengths and Weaknesses of Each Model

The comparison shows **clear strengths and weaknesses** for each model:

#### ü§î GPT-5: The Deliberate Thinker

- **‚úÖ Strengths**: _Advanced reasoning_, _careful problem-solving_, _high-quality outputs_.
- **‚ùå Weaknesses**: _Slower_, _uses more tokens_, _sometimes makes errors_.

#### ‚ö° Claude Sonnet: The Speed Artist

- **‚úÖ Strengths**: _Extremely fast_, _creates visually appealing outputs_, _uses tokens efficiently_.
- **‚ùå Weaknesses**: _Inconsistent with schemas_, _methods are less reliable_, _sometimes gives incomplete solutions_.

## Choosing the Right Model for Your Needs

So, which one is for you? The answer is: **it depends**.

- Choose **GPT-5** if your project needs **_accuracy, complex reasoning, and detailed outputs_**. It is the **thinker**.
- Choose **Claude Sonnet** if your project needs **_speed, visual appeal, and quick iterations_**. It is the **artist**.

Both models are still improving. More testing will give us better insights into their skills, helping developers make **smarter choices** in the future.
