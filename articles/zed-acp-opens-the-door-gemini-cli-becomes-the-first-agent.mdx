# Zed ACP Opens the Door: Gemini CLI Becomes the First Agent

Zed has always focused on speed and flexibility. Now it is enabling AI agents inside the editor itself. The key is the **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)**, an open-source bridge built by Zed. Google's **Gemini CLI** is the first agent to connect through it.

## Who Did What

- **Zed** created the **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)**, an open framework that allows any AI agent to integrate into the editor.
- **Google** built **Gemini CLI**, an open-source AI agent for terminal-based workflows. It was designed to be extensible from the start with standards like MCP, markdown instructions, themes, custom tools, configs, and telemetry.
- **Together**, this collaboration makes Gemini CLI the first official agent to run in Zed using ACP.

In just eight weeks since launch, Gemini CLI has already seen over 1,000 community pull requests, showing how quickly its ecosystem is growing.

## What This Enables

- **Use Gemini inside Zed**: Run `gemini` in Zed's terminal or interact with it through the new Agent Panel.
- **Code generation and refactoring**: Write a comment, hit a hotkey, and get working code in place.
- **Instant explanations**: Highlight confusing code or an error message to get a clear answer.
- **Natural chat**: Ask Gemini broader questions directly in Zed's integrated terminal.
- **Complex multi-file changes**: Gemini can add endpoints, generate tests, or refactor code across multiple files while you follow its progress in real time.

When the agent finishes, Zed presents the changes in a **review interface** that works like a pull request. You can inspect diffs, accept, reject, or modify suggestions before they land in your project.

You can also provide **external context** like API specs or docs, so Gemini has the knowledge it needs for harder problems.

## Why It Matters

- **Performance**: Zed's Rust foundation makes the editor fast. Adding Gemini keeps that same responsiveness while giving you AI assistance.
- **Control**: You are never flying blind. You see edits as they happen and approve them before they go in.
- **Extensibility**: ACP is open. Gemini is just the first agent. Any AI that supports ACP can be integrated into Zed in the future.
- **Community-driven growth**: With Gemini CLI already attracting major community contributions, this integration is set to evolve rapidly.

## Conclusion

This is more than an AI plug-in. It is a new foundation. **Zed built ACP to open the door, and Google brought Gemini CLI through it as the first real-world agent.**

It shows how editors and AI agents can work together without breaking the developer's flow.
